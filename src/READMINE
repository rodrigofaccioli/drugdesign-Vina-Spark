In this directory contains Python scripts to complete analysis of virtual screening by Apache Spark [1].

After performing virtual screening by Autodock Vina, the below scripts can be able to run.

* prepare_ligand.py
prepare ligands for performing virtual screening. 

* create_file_for_analysis.py	(Required)
It must be your first step for analysis. It will create a txt file that all score of log files will be sorted by score. 

* prepare_files_for_analysis.py	(Required)
It must be your second step for analysis. It will prepare all files for analysis. The Vina structures output will be organizated into
directories that are used in next steps of analysis.

* buried_areas.py
buried areas are computed. buried_area.txt file wiil be generated.
buried_areas.py <probe> <ndots>. Example: buried_areas.py 0.14 24.

* ligand_efficiency.py
computes the ligand efficency.

* vs_full_data_analysis.py
it performs a join of all files into vs_full_data_analysis.txt file.
